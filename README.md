# ⚽ La Liga Data Analysis (2019–2025)

This project explores data from Spain’s top football division — **La Liga** — covering all matches between the 2019 and 2025 seasons. The goal is to extract meaningful insights using data analysis and visualization techniques, while practicing end-to-end data storytelling.

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - La Liga Matches Dataset (FBref)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marcelbiezunski/laliga-matches-dataset-2019-2025-fbref/data)
- Author: Marcel Biezunski
- Seasons: 2019–2025  
- Features include: date, teams, goals, expected goals (xG), possession, penalties, referee, attendance, formations, and more.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on real match data.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover team behaviors and performance trends.
- Visualize differences between home and away performance.
- Compare expected goals (xG) to actual goals scored.
- Evaluate penalty efficiency by team.
- Analyze performance by time and day of the week.
- Build a clear, shareable portfolio project showcasing insights.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Home Advantage**: Teams playing at home had a significantly higher win percentage compared to those playing away.
- **Top Scorers**: Clubs like Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Atlético Madrid dominated in total and average goals per match.
- **xG vs Actual Goals**: Most teams aligned closely with their expected goal values, but some over- or under-performed consistently.
- **Penalty Efficiency**: Espanyol had a 100% penalty conversion rate, while traditionally stronger teams like Real Madrid and Barcelona underperformed in this aspect.
- **Time & Day Patterns**: Certain days and hours had slightly higher average points per match, possibly indicating tactical or environmental advantages.
